## Vue

An incrementally adoptable ecosystem that scales between a library and a full-featured framework.

This is mainly focused on view layer only. And is easy to integrate with other libraries and projects.

### The Progressive JavaScript Framework

Framework that you can insert into your project as you feel the need for it. Unlike other frameworks like Angular, which requires a full project.

| Vue | Angular |
| --- | ----------- |
| JS based | TS based |
| easy to learn | step learning curve |

Both offer data binding to DOM, but Vue is much more lightweight.
